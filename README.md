# priscajs
Priscajs is a JavaScript library that intends to achieve a lot with few lines of codes.

**Demonstration**
```
    //`i` represents the current iteration value.
    from (1 to 10) {
        say (i)
    }
```

**The following block is an example `for` loop equivalent of the above code in Vanilla JavaScript**
```
    for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        alert (i);
    }
```
